# SOC-25-Building-LLM-from-Scratch
In the project build LLM from Scratch, we first started with python, beginner friendly and language useful in various domains.
It is very effective in handling data and hence in used in LLMs due to its built in libraries mainly numpy, pytorch, Tensorflow, etc.
Started with learning basic syntax of python, elements in it like list, tuple, sets, etc. and then also file handling and classes in python.
Then libraries mainly numpy and pytorch. In NumPy, learn about arrays, slicing arrays, mathematical operations on them, and random number generation, file operations.
In Pytorch, learned about tensors, autograd, training loop, nn.module, dataset and dataloaders.
